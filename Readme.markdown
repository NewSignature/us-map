# US Map #

This is a fork of the fantastic NewSignature US Map jQuery plugin. 

I made this fork to add the feature of allowing users to specify new styles based on users clicking on specific states.

This project is not yet complete and the feature is not yet implemented in this repo (I have completed the feature but not made it publically available yet).
